## 👋 About Me

I am an **IT & Infrastructure professional** with strong hands-on experience across:

- **Linux system administration**
- **Network administration & troubleshooting**
- **Windows Server & Active Directory**
- **Security-aware IT operations**

I don’t just study theory. I **build, break, fix, document, and secure systems** the same way internal IT teams and MSPs do across Europe.

This GitHub is intentionally structured to support **remote, English-speaking roles**, including:

- IT Support Engineer (L1 / L2)
- Associate System Administrator (Junior-Mid)
- Network Administrator (Junior-Mid)
- Linux Administrator (Junior–Mid)
- Technical Support Engineer (Infrastructure-focused)

Every project here demonstrates:
- Real enterprise tools
- Practical troubleshooting workflows
- Clear documentation written for teams
- A mindset aligned with **uptime, security, and business continuity**

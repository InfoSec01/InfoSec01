# About Me

I design and manage enterprise-style lab environments that reflect real-world infrastructure operations.

My work focuses on structured system deployment, domain management, network configuration, security controls, and operational troubleshooting across Windows and Linux environments.

Each repository demonstrates hands-on configuration, issue simulation, root-cause analysis, and clear technical documentation.

I approach infrastructure methodically:

Plan → Deploy → Validate → Break → Troubleshoot → Secure → Document → Improve

Reliable systems are built intentionally.
They are designed, tested, secured, and documented.
